/**
 * Professional Session Persistence System
 * ====================================
 * 
 * This system ensures users remain logged in across browser refreshes
 * and provides a seamless authentication experience.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * -------------
 * âœ… Automatic session restoration on app startup
 * âœ… Professional loading states during initialization
 * âœ… Silent error handling for network issues
 * âœ… Proper token validation and expiration handling
 * âœ… No more unwanted redirects to login page
 * âœ… Smooth user experience with visual feedback
 * 
 * How it Works:
 * ------------
 * 1. On app startup, check localStorage for JWT token
 * 2. If token exists, validate format and restore session
 * 3. Fetch user profile to complete authentication
 * 4. Handle errors gracefully without disrupting UX
 * 5. Only redirect to login if truly unauthenticated
 * 
 * Components Involved:
 * -------------------
 * - useSessionPersistence.js: Main authentication logic
 * - ProfessionalAuthWrapper.jsx: UI wrapper with proper states
 * - Updated auth actions: Enhanced session restoration
 * - Login.jsx: Cleaner login without redundant logic
 * 
 * Testing:
 * --------
 * 1. Login to the application
 * 2. Refresh the browser (F5 or Ctrl+R)
 * 3. User should remain authenticated without login redirect
 * 4. Professional loading screen should show briefly
 * 5. Navigate directly to authenticated pages - no login required
 *
