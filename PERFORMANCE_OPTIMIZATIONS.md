## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 📈 Performance Metrics Expected

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100ms
- **Bundle Size Reduction**: ~30% smaller with code splitting

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Service Worker implementation for offline support
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Image compression and WebP support
- Progressive Web App features
- Advanced caching strategies
- Real-time updates optimization

## 🎯 Key Benefits
